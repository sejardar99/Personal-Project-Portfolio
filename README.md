## AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analytics

### Problem Statement
The problem statement and dataset for this project have been taken from the Resume Project Challenges of Codebasics. 
AtliQ Mart is a hypothetical FMCG manufacturing company that has faced non-extension of their annual contracts by a few key customers because some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued time period, which could have resulted in bad customer service.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset consisted of OT (On Time), IF (In Full) and OTIF (On Time In Full) delivery information at the order line level as well as aggregated order level, and also OT, IF and OTIF Target % for every customer. Apart from this, there was data on quantity ordered and quantity sold at order line level, order placement date, delivery date at order line level, customer and product details.

### Project Overview
This project is basically a supply chain analysis of AtliQ Mart, using Advanced Excel tools, mainly Power Query and Power Pivot. Data cleaning was perfomed in Power Query. The cleaned dataset was loaded into the Excel Data Model and necessary relationships were built across tables using Diagram View. Query merge was also performed between some tables in Power Query as and when was found necessary.
DAX in Power Pivot was used to create measures like OT %, IF %, OTIF %, differences between these actual metrics and given targets, LIFR (Line Fill Rate) % and VOFR (Volume Fill Rate) %.
Filters by order placement date, week number and month have been put in the pivot tables wherever applicable.

The following 6 Pivot table reports have been created in this project - 
OT, IF and OTIF Performance by Customers
OTIF Performance by Customers and Months
LIFR and VOFR Performance by Customers
LIFR and VOFR Performance by Customers and Months
LIFR and VOFR Performance by Products
LIFR and VOFR Performance by Products and Months
